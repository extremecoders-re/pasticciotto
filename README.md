![Pasticciotto]

# What is this?
Pasticciotto is a virtual machine which can be used to obfuscate code. It was developed for the **PoliCTF 17** as a reversing challenge.

The key feature is its **opcode "shuffling"**: their actual values are determined by a password. (More in [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION.md))

I wanted to experiment with VM obfuscation since it was a topic that caught my attention while reversing challenges for various CTFs. So, I decided to write one **from scratch** in order to understand better how instruction set architectures are implemented! 

The design and the implementation behind Pasticciotto are not state-of-the-art but hey, it works! :D

# Why "Pasticciotto"?
In Italian, "Pasticciotto" has two meanings! 

The first one is **"little mess"** which perfectly describes how I put up this project. The second one is a typical dessert from Southern Italy, Salento! It's filled with cream! Yum!

# Quick start

You can use `pasticciotto` in your own binary! It's easy to do!

## Assemble!
Let's say you want to run this `C` code into `pasticciotto`:
```c
void main() {
    uint16_t i, a, b;
    a = 0;
    b = 0x10;

    for (i = 0; i < b; i++) {
        a += b;
    }
    return;
}
```

It can be translated into this `pasticciotto`'s assembly snippet:
```
$ cat example.pstc
def main:
movi r0, 0x0  # a
movi r1, 0x10 # b
movi s1, 0x0  # i
loop:
addr r0, r1
addi s1, 1
cmpr s1, r1
jpbi loop
shit
```
Let's assemble it with key `HelloWorld`:
```
$ python3 assembler.py HelloWorld example.pstc example_assembled.pstc
```

Now we are ready to embed the VM in a `.c` program:
```c++
#include "vm/vm.h"
#include <fstream>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    /*
    In order to create the bytecode for pasticciotto, you can use
    the assembler in the assembler/ directory. You can include it with
    `xxd -i example_assembled.pstc`
    */
    unsigned char example_assembled_pstc[] = {
    0x32, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x32, 0x01, 0x10, 0x00, 0x32, 0x05, 0x00, 0x00,
    0xaf, 0x01, 0xcf, 0x05, 0x01, 0x00, 0x8b, 0x51, 0xc5, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x0c
    };
    unsigned int example_assembled_pstc_len = 24;
    unsigned char key[] = {
    0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64, 0x0a
    };


    puts("I should try to eat a pasticciotto...\n");
    VM vm(key, example_assembled_pstc, example_assembled_pstc_len);
    vm.run();
    return 0;
}
```
That's it!

## Accessing to the VM's sections and registers

The VM **data / code / stack sections** are represented through the `VMAddrSpace` object. It is defined [here](vm/vmas.h). The **registers** are in a `uint16_t` array in the `VM` object defined [here](vm/vm.h).

```c++
void foo() {
    // creating the VM with some code
    VM vm(key, code, codelen);

    // accessing the data section
    printf("First data byte: 0x%x", VM.addrSpace()->getData()[0]);
    // accessing the code section
    printf("First code byte: 0x%x", VM.addrSpace()->getCode()[0]);    
    // accessing the stack section
    printf("First stack byte: 0x%x", VM.addrSpace()->getStack()[0]);
    // accessing the IP register
    printf("The IP is: 0x%x", VM.regs(IP));
    return;
}
```


# What about the challenge?
You can find the client and the server under the `polictf/` directory. I have also written a small writeup. Check it out!

# Compiling

These are the presets in the `Makefile`:

1. `all` will compile the emulator and the PoliCTF server/client **WITHOUT** debug symbols. (default)
2. `emulator` will compile only the emulator **WITHOUT** debug symbols.
3. `polictf` will compile only the PoliCTF server/client **WITHOUT** debug symbols.
4. `debug` will compile the emulator and the PoliCTF server/client **WITH** debug symbols.
5. `test` will compile and run the tests in the `tests/` directory.

So, to get up and running it's enough to run:
> `$ make`

# Implementation details
Check out the file [IMPLEMENTATION.MD](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) to understand how the VM works and which operations it can do! Watch out for some spoilers if you haven't completed the challenge though!

# Contributions

I wanted to polish the VM even more but I haven't got the time to do it. There are rough edges for sure!

Any contribution is **very** welcome! Feel free to open issues and pull requests!
